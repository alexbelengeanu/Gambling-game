# Gambling-game v1.1
A virtual gambling game that I developed using C++. <br>Some few options it contains so far :
- Gamble on number between 1-10 ; if you guess the lucky number, you get (10 * your betting amount)$
- Add an amount of money to your deposit
- Cash out from your deposit.

I also created a simple interface to get the player's nickname and the initial amount of money that user is willing to gamble.<br><br>
Other options that I am thinking of implementing: <br>
    - gamble on different intervals of numbers(e.g: 1-50, 1-100 - with a higher prize) <br>
    - gamble on colors(e.g: red/black)<br><br>
In this project I made some functions to validate the input for different data types(int/char), practiced the rand() function, practiced the do..while() loop, implemented an 'user friendly' interface with nicknames and a deposit etc.
