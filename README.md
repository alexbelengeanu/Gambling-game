# Gambling-game v1.1
A virtual gambling game that I developed using C++. Some few options it contains so far :
- Gamble on number between 1-10 ; if you guess the lucky number, you get (10 * your betting amount)$
- Add an amount of money to your deposit
- Cash out from your deposit.

I also created a simple interface to get the player's nickname and the initial amount of money that user is willing to gamble.\n
other options that I am thinking of implementing:
    - gamble on different intervals of numbers(e.g: 1-50, 1-100 - with a higher prize)
    - gamble on colors(e.g: red/black)
